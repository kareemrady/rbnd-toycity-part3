How long did you spend working on this project?
The project took me a total of 8 hrs distrubuted on 3 days
What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
Adding a return capability, lots of different ways to do it but finding the best way is a bit of a challenge
What two additional features did you build? Why?
- ADD a return capability for a bought product - makes sense specially this a toy store
-track purchases per user - in order to be able to execute the return properly i needed to track all purchases by a user
- Added a refund variable and method so that i can support the return product properly
- show customer purchases -makes sense that you would store all purchases made by a specific user
-show all transactions - track all transactions even refunds
Where do you still have room to grow?
I believe more practice is needed, specially around how the different classes interact to create a feature right now that requires alot of thinking and alot of trilas to get the functionality working
